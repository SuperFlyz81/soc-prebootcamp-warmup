## Usage

- Create a new folder on your computer and then clone (or download and extract) this GitHub repository to that folder.

- Then double-click the index.html file in that folder to view the replicated Airbnb mobile homepage.

To get a better idea of how the homepage will look on a mobile browser, open your browser's dev tools. Then use the dev tools' device toolbar / responsive design mode to emulate viewing the homepage on the mobile device of your choice.
